# Beginners-repo

A beginner-friendly repository for Hacktoberfest 2025! This project collects simple coding contributions, helping newcomers get started with open source.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

The main goal of this repository is to provide a welcoming space for beginners to make their first open-source contributions for **Hacktoberfest 2025**. We are collecting simple, self-contained coding examples, such as:

* Data Structures and Algorithms (e.g., a sorting algorithm, a tree traversal)
* Simple utilities (e.g., a km-to-miles converter, a simple calculator)
* Basic web snippets (e.g., a simple HTML/CSS login form)

## ðŸ’» Languages Accepted

We welcome contributions in (but are not limited to) the following languages:

* Java
* Python
* C++
* HTML / CSS
* JavaScript

## ðŸš€ How to Contribute

Follow these simple steps to make your contribution:

1.  **Find an Issue:** Look through the existing [Issues](https://github.com/YashK-194/Beginners-repo/issues) to find a task you'd like to work on. If you have a new idea, please **create a new issue first** to discuss it with the maintainers.
2.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your own copy.
3.  **Create a New Branch:** On your fork, create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b add-bubble-sort`).
4.  **Add Your Code:** Add your new file(s) to an appropriate folder. If a folder for your language or algorithm doesn't exist, feel free to create it.
5.  **Commit and Push:** Commit your changes with a clear message and push them to your fork (e.g., `git push origin add-bubble-sort`).
6.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Go to the original repository and open a Pull Request from your branch. Please **link the issue** you are solving in your PR description (e.g., `Closes #123`).

## âœ… Submission Guidelines

To help us keep the repository clean and easy to navigate, please follow these rules:

* **File Naming:** Use clear and descriptive file names (e.g., `BubbleSort.java` or `KmToMilesConverter.py`).
* **Code Quality:** Your code should be well-commented, explaining what it does.
* **Originality:** Please submit your own original code.
* **No "Hello World":** We are not accepting basic "Hello World" programs. Please aim for something slightly more complex (like the examples in the Project Goal).
* **README (if needed):** If your contribution is a new utility or in a new folder, please add a simple `README.md` inside that folder explaining what it is.

Happy coding, and thank you for contributing to Hacktoberfest 2025!
